# Boba Spotter
A sample project for [HCDE 498](https://github.com/HCDE498UXFrontEndWebDev)
implementing [`react-router`](https://www.github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
, [`material-ui`](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), and other frameworks.

## Getting Started
Clone or download the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Baddaboo/boba-spotter.git
```
Install the necessary libraries:
```
npm install
```
Run the project:
```
npm run start
```
You can also see the app deployed live at:

## Notes
- This project not only demonstrates how to implement frameworks, but also how you might want to organize your project. I'd recommend taking a look at the structure of the `components`, `providers`, and `views` folder.
